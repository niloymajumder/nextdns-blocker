## [3.0.0] - 2024-11-27

### Added
- **Health Check Command**: `./blocker.bin health` - Comprehensive system health verification
  - API connectivity check
  - Configuration validation
  - Timezone verification
  - Pause state status
  - Log directory accessibility
  - Cache status
- **Statistics Command**: `./blocker.bin stats` - Usage statistics from audit log
  - Total blocks/unblocks count
  - Total pauses count
  - Last action timestamp
- **Dry-run Mode**: `./blocker.bin sync --dry-run` - Preview changes without applying
  - Shows what would be blocked/unblocked
  - Displays current vs expected state
  - Summary of changes
- **Verbose Mode**: `./blocker.bin sync --verbose` or `-v`
  - Detailed output of all sync actions
  - Per-domain status display
  - Summary at completion
- **Denylist Cache**: Smart caching to reduce API calls
  - 60-second TTL with automatic invalidation
  - Optimistic updates on block/unblock
  - `refresh_cache()` method for manual refresh
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against API rate limits
  - Sliding window algorithm (30 requests/minute)
  - Automatic waiting when limit reached
- **Exponential Backoff**: Automatic retries with increasing delays
  - Base delay: 1 second, max: 30 seconds
  - Retries on timeout, 429, and 5xx errors
- **is_blocked() Method**: Convenience method in NextDNSClient
- **Shared utilities module**: `common.py` with `ensure_log_dir()` for lazy initialization
- 287 tests with 92% code coverage

### Changed
- Default retries increased from 2 to 3
- URL validation regex is now stricter (requires valid TLD)
- Overnight range boundary handling improved (end time exclusive)
- `time` import renamed to `dt_time` to avoid conflicts
- Log directory creation is now lazy (no side effects on import)

### Fixed
- **Race condition in `is_paused()`**: Removed file existence check before acquiring lock
- **Double fd close bug**: Fixed file descriptor handling in `write_secure_file`
- **find_domain redundancy**: Simplified return value
- **Documentation**: Corrected test coverage percentage (92%)
- **API_RETRIES default**: Fixed inconsistency in .env.example (was 2, now 3)

### Security
- Race condition fix prevents potential timing attacks on pause state
- Rate limiting prevents accidental API abuse
- Input validation strengthened for URLs

## [2.1.0] - 2024-11-27

### Added
- Comprehensive test suite with 243 tests (91% coverage)
- Tests for watchdog.py (93% coverage)
- Time format validation in schedule configuration (HH:MM format)
- Early timezone validation at config load time
- Domain trailing dot validation (rejects FQDN notation)
- Named constants for domain validation (MAX_DOMAIN_LENGTH, MAX_LABEL_LENGTH)
- CHANGELOG.md for version tracking

### Fixed
- Race condition in `write_secure_file` - chmod now applied atomically
- File locking consistency in watchdog.py
- Improved error messages for invalid time formats

### Security
- Secure file creation with `os.open()` and proper permissions from start
- File locking on all sensitive file operations

## [2.0.0] - 2024-11-26

### Added

- Pause/resume functionality with expiration
- Watchdog for cron job protection
- Audit logging for all blocking actions

### Changed
- Complete refactor for production quality
- Separated blocker and watchdog into independent scripts

## [1.0.0] - 2024-11-25

### Added
- Initial release
- Basic domain blocking via NextDNS API
- Simple time-based scheduling
- Cron-based automatic sync
